# Sponsors

## Introducci√≥n


From the point of view of a company that has decided to use Stream Hatchet's BI I think it would be useful to add a section where users could check easily which sponsors each streamer has, 
as well as the sponsors that participate in different tournaments.

I am positive that these data can be collected and be of great value to many kinds of companies.

##Buttons

In this section we could show the sponsors separated in different buttons, such as:

Streamers
Teams
Tournaments
Channels
Stream Platforms


This options should be clickable and would have a dropdown where you could search for the target of interest. 
Once you have it selected the sponsors would appear in a list.
In the tournament section we could also show the dates of the events.
All of this information also would have a link to their respective section in order to obtain more information of it.

Another interesting section should be a "minor streamers" chart, consisting on new streamers or teams who has recently been gaining popularity and would be a more economical 
target to be approached by sponsors. We could show this with a line graphic or an histogram.
Once we have these data we could show a pie chart or another kind of graphic with the companies that invest more in each sectors.
